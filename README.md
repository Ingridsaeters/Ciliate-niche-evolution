## To-do list

### To-do
- Check if terrestrial sampling biases inferred evolutionary rates. *Ingrid*
  - Prune 10, 20, 30, 50, and 70% of ASVs and infer evolutionary rates for terrestrial ciliates (for any 5 variables including temp and precipitation).  
  - Prune away all ASVs from Europe, North America, and South East Asia (one by one) and infer evolutionary rates for terrestrial ciliates (for any 5 variables including temp and precipitation).
- Download new version of EukBank (https://zenodo.org/records/7804946). *Ingrid*
- Download animal and plant phylogenies and metadata from Liu et al 2020. *Mahwash*
- Test DBM on animal and plants. *Mahwash*
- Test Evorates on animals and plants. *Mahwash*
- Check if metaPR2 has greater ciliate diversity. *Mahwash* (If yes, switch to metaPR2??).
- Infer new ciliate phylogenies with EukBank (or metaPR2). *Ingrid*
