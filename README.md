# Ciliate-niche-evolution

## To-do
1. Find Dinoflagellate and Ciliate fossils
2. Rerun analyses with MAFFT L-ins-i
3. Infer 100 ML trees (RAxML or RAxML NG?)
4. Choose 10 trees or fewer to maximize the topological diversity
5. Add EukBank data (1 tree per backbone or 100 trees per backbone?)
6. Date the trees (Bayesian or ML?)
7. Get MCC trees (Maximum Clade Credibility trees)

## Things to consider in analyses

1. How to deal with possible contaminants in metabarcoding data? Filter out low abundance sequences?
2. For each OTU present in a sample, should we take the mean annual temperature, or the temperature at the time of collection?

## Fossils used for calibration
