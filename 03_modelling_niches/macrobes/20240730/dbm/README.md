# DBM analyses started on 30-07-2024

## Settings

Settings were as follows:

Number of iterations used as burn-in : 5,000,000
Number of iterations post burn-in: 15,000,000
Recording frequency: 15,000
Î´t (time discretized): 1e-3
mxthf: 0.05

## Submitting analyses
To start with, just running analyses on a subset of phylogenies until I figure out the optimum settings. 

```
for i in *scaled.10.tre; do file=$(echo $i | cut -f1 -d '.'); sbatch dbm.sbatch $i "$file".dbm.txt "$file".scaled.10.dbm.out; sleep 1; done
``` 

## Submitting the rest
Alright, let's try the other trees now!
